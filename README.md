# PersonDB
This program has to do with storing people's names and other details such as their age on a database (SQLite) and you can perform the CRUD method on the data.

## What I learned:
I learned how to use SQLite and how to apply the CRUD method on a database, that is Updating, Adding, and Removing data from the database.
